# To-Do List Application

## Description

This is a simple To-Do List application built with Angular. The app allows you to add, edit, and delete tasks. The tasks are persisted in `localStorage`, so even after refreshing the page, your tasks will remain.

## Features

- Add new tasks to your to-do list.
- Edit and update existing tasks.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- All tasks are saved in the browser's `localStorage`, ensuring persistence after page reload.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular**: A platform for building client-side applications.
- **localStorage**: A simple way to store data in the browser.

## Installation

## How It Works

 

**Add Task**: You can add a new task by typing it in the input field and clicking the "Add" button.

**Edit Task**: Click the "Edit" button next to a task to modify its content. After editing, click "Save" to update it.

**Delete Task**: Click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the list.

The tasks are stored in the browser's localStorage, so they persist even after refreshing the page.
